atomic types
characters: char(20), varchar(50)
numbers: int, bigint, smallint, float
others: money, datetime

every attributes must have an atomic type
hence tables are flat

VARCHAR(20)

schema of a table is the table name, its attributes, and their types

a key is an attribute whose values are unique; we underline a key

a key is a minimal subset of attributes that acts as a unique idneitifer for tuples in a creation
a key is an implicit constraint on which tuples can be in the relation
if two tuples agree on the value of the key, then they must be the same tuple
