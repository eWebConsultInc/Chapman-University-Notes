Physical Schema: describes data layout
reslations ads unordered files
some data in sorted order

logical schema
the way that the tables are represented with their specific data attributes

Relation scheme
Beers(name: string, manf: string)

relation schema = relation name and attribute list
database = collection of relations
database schema = set of all relations schemas in the database

Data independence
Concept: applications do not need to worry about how the data is stored and structured

logical data independence: protection from changes in the logical structure of the data
should not need to ask: can we add a new entity or attribute without rewriting the applications

physical data independence: protection from physical layout changes
should not need to ask which disks are the data stored on? is the data indexed?

fault tolerance and query languages
