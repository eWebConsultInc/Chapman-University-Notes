My pure disdain for this class can be seen in my code (no error handling)

I've taken Advanced Android Development and got an A-

I've taken Data Structures and Algorithms in C++ and got a B+ (where this Intro to Java class is a pre-requisite)

Oh my days why am I surrounding myself with stupid people... requirements are requirements sadly.
