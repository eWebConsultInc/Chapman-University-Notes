hiya i need input
if UX is catered heavily in favor of the consultancy/branding/engineering departments, what aspect about UX can be applied to other deps?

REDACTED
it can be also applied to marketing
for example
in creating marketing packages
you can also apply wireframing in making the flow of your package
how do you present the details in such a way that it would convince others to partner up with you

REDACTED
customer experience
using ux methods to come up with a better output
strategy through design
always putting the user in mind when doing ur shit

REDACTED
In events, the simplest of planning can be done with UX in mind. You will have to adapt to the mindsets of the "participants" and design your events directed towards your members. You can use a lot of methods to be applied in event directing.

REDACTED
optimizing and redesigning processes through user experience
in creating, sustaining organizations, also use user experience haha
same concepts pa rin
UX skills kasi is very broad
it should include communication, strategy, influence, facilitation, writing/copywriting
kaya its always hard to define UX
its the bane of all people
hahahaha

Xavi
ok here's the conundrum i fear i'm going to run into. this applies to non-engi/consultancy/branding directors. why would I market for an org like UXSoc when i could get a paid internship in marketing?

REDACTED
Ahhhhh haha
Well don't US schools have org systems too

REDACTED
it's not mutually exclusive kasi

REDACTED
don't students apply for positions there?
and yeah it's not mutually exclusive

REDACTED
ung pinakamagaling na kilala ko lahat nagagawa
acads + interning + orgs + side gigz
it's doable
it's more like
in service of the community
usually, for the network
working with a team
looking for mentors, expanding your skills horizontally
it's like building yourself to be a T-skilled person
u know everything pero u dam good at marketing
or u know everything at marketing pero u dam good at SEO

Xavi
so basically you're saying UX is a flare that should be added on top of someone's skillset

REDACTED
YESS
UX can be used in marketing
in fact, it has a lot of parallels
marketers also do personas, customer journeys
they go deep depths to understand how people desire something
pair that with UX then boom
plus, it will help them ease into product teams in the future
kung marketing yun yung pinaka sagot
it complements

Xavi
so in other words start learning your flare early so more opportunities will be open once you graduate

REDACTED
u cant just suggest random stuff to people kasi
what do you mean flare HAHAHAHAHA

Xavi
the thing you're unique at

REDACTED
put yourself in their perspective bro
use UX
look into their motivations
wants
needs
how will you persuade them
get into their heads
HAHAHAHrrAHA
pero before you can get into their heads yun nga, you need research
you need to be ahead
for them to follow you
you need to seem like u know ur shit

REDACTED
you can UX your pitch to them to join

REDACTED
yep
always take it from their perspective
not from urs
make it personal rin
wag ung template style HAHHAHAHA
affirm their potential, how they can help the org, why they should go for it
what they would be missing if they didn't
elevator pitch
what's your unique value proposition

REDACTED
wait but are you trying to recruit person by person
or are you thinking of making some sort of fb post to get people to apply

Xavi
person by person, once established then application process

REDACTED
that's easier then
cuz yeah you can UX your message/pitch to each one of them

Xavi
spoke to 5 professors and pitched to 10 diff classes in the arts/CS departments because facebook posting doesn't work for days

REDACTED
dathustle haha

REDACTED
WAIT HAHA
so i'm expecting a much better turnout this thursday

REDACTED
it's important to screen them through some kind of process
kahit person by person
are you talking about EB?

REDACTED
yeah
well actually kahit sino
@Xavi Ablaza https://medium.com/trailblazer-stories/5-mistakes-i-made-in-building-a-high-performance-organization-c2592bcd9cff
Don't just get anyone
They have to be "the one"
like how we picked you

Xavi
so my friend REDACTED invited me to this christian rapper concert

REDACTED
Stop

Xavi
the end

REDACTED
GIPHY

Xavi
i went and i was confused as fuck dude

REDACTED
Why the fuck

Xavi
how can 50 REDACTED people

REDACTED
Do you end up with these losers

Xavi
listen to a christian rapper
mfg
after the event he asked me bro
"so what did you think of the event?"
"you know bro i just kinda spaced out i just liked the beats tho"
i honestly wanted to tell him i didn't give a fuck

REDACTED
Tenor GIF Keyboard

Xavi
my org had an event today, spoke to 10 classes and only around 8-10 people went
i invited an information designer to speak about her experiences and her work
org culture is so dead
people would rather get exp thru having a job

REDACTED
Just like the REDACTED that REDACTED

Xavi
in ateneo/dlsu org culture is so strong
i dont get it


REDACTED
For a REDACTED that happened 4 years ago
That's because our society isn't that fucked yet
You can easily see it in that comparison
From you own experience even
Your

Xavi
from my own exp bro even though i took a gap sem
my friends who've stayed in school haven't developed my skills yet
so what the hell is the point of going to school then
why do people prioritize their jobs over school
their shit fucking jobs
of working as cashiers and sales reps

REDACTED
Do you know why "the asian" stereotype exists in the eyes of american students

Xavi
why

REDACTED
Backread what you just said

Xavi
ok....

REDACTED
You already know the fact that everything an average american has is taken for granted

Xavi
why isn't there a willingness for these people to pursue MORE
academically and this quest for knowledge to get a wide understanding of multiple fields of study
thats the point of school isnt it

REDACTED
I think you'll have a better time with students who pay for their own tuition.

Xavi
here's something i also don't understand bro

REDACTED
Ok what

Xavi
there's this asian american cultural club right, why would you dedicate your time to doing that when it won't have an effect on your future after you graduate
the prevalent problems are focused on race and gender awareness and how the hell does that pull so many people together?
there is no succinct end goal for these people
tbh i'm having the hardest time grasping why these things are so important to people

REDACTED
Do you know why Older generations look down on millenials?

Xavi
because of what i said?
REDACTED issues

REDACTED
Partly. But millenials are pieces of shit who don't care about making it high and hard anymore

Xavi
dude no matter where you are today everything should come with hard work

REDACTED
So the shit that you go through "activities that have no end game" a.k.a "a waste of time" is something that millenials like to do

Xavi
like im pretty sure that wherever you yourself are today you achieved with hard work

REDACTED
That's obvious

Xavi
but people these days are so easily distracted
people meaning millenials

REDACTED
Yes
Trash
I told you long ago that you'd see things the way I do in one way or another
This millenial shit is one
The next thing is the end game on what you do to your family relationships & friends.
Because there will be leashes and loose ends. Or plainly dead weight.
That's when you decide what kind of man you're going to become with business side by side.
For example i've had very successful friends in my inner circle that i had to let go of
Coz they got into deep shit that will weight you down while you're trying to push for your individual success
Anyway going back to your problem with society

Xavi
the reason i'm asking this is because i want to recruit people for my org
i want to get into the heads of these people and understand why or why wont they attend

REDACTED
Did your org try doing a survey to student bodies
Asking their personal interests and would they br interested in what your doing
You're

Xavi
nope

REDACTED
Do it

Xavi
ill give you an example bro of an org on campus

REDACTED
Okay

Xavi
student government wants to change its constitutional guidelines for how many people are elected to the senate. for a change like this to happen 20% of student population need to vote. 20% is around 1200 students
less than 10% voted

REDACTED
Okay, not too surprised with attempted change.

Xavi
so what the senators did is they literally walked around campus with ipads and candy and encouraged people to vote
they breezed it to just over 20% on the deadline of voting
what i aim to do with my org is how do we design a strategy so that people will care about these kinds of things?
i'll give you another problem. University Programming Board is the largest student org on campus that gets a lot of funding. every semester they hold a concert featuring a named artist
this year they spent $20,000 to get gnash to play on campus
they offered free tickets and only 200 students went
that's around 2% of student population
so my end goal for my org, when i graduate is to improve the org environment and making people realize that being part of my org can lead to an ease into the workforce. it will give you a competitive advantage
now idk how compelling of an argument that is

REDACTED
So you're basically offering something better than an existing org titan

Xavi
it's an org that supports existing orgs

REDACTED
Lol then what you need is marketing
And ears
Idk how you'll get those types of people/millenials but having a survey would make this a little bit more accurate for where to find people like that and what kind of people you should be getting
Its totally upto your speakers and marketing people to convince peoppe to even show up and listen to what you guys do
So if you keep doing surveys it would be easier for you guys to know what you're after
Instead of just hey bro check this out to everyone

Xavi
like ive tried facebook marketing, that shit mega failed
spoke to 10 classes this week, only a few came only because prof offered extra credit
only like 2-3 people came because they were genuinely interested
logistics wise i'm gonna invite a ton of speakers to come in every week to talk about user experience design and why its important
i'm assuming here that people don't want to start shit, they just want to be a part of something that's already successful and up and running

REDACTED
you know what you can do
extend your reach
with the org members that you're getting
You'll have to offer them something as well

Xavi
i have one slide in my presentation tomorrow that asks people what orgs they're a part of
and how knowing about ux design can improve the functionality of their orgs
how can these orgs recruit more people, how do we design events that people will genuinely be interested in, etc.
how do we build a branded org that serves some sort of purpose to the university?
once we do that with small clubs we could take on org titans like the student gov't
you think that's good or do people need even more convincing?

Xavi
negative style, if you're not part of this org what would you be missing out on?
you're probably thinking you can get by with these kinds of skills
get to know people who might be useful for your field in the future
