There are some questions I have about the design spec on figma. Are the sections designed to feature content on a global scale? Would member stories show stories from any member in any chapter? Job board would have jobs scouted by or endorsed by any chapter in the world? Case studies written by any member in any chapter? Who controls what will be on each section? Events will have events on a global scale?

What if a particular UXSoc chapter focuses on a lot of events over their consultancy to build their team? How would that content be showed on the global uxsoc site?

Some sections are also chapter-specific, like the Work section. Let's say my chapter doesn't have a consultancy team. It would be problematic to have a "What we can do for you" section when not all chapters will have a solid consultancy team.

So to solve this, I'd like to propose that the design spec be a template that other chapters can use. The design would be modular, such that if my chapter for example doesn't have a solid consultancy I can choose to disable the Work section. If my chapter needs a section like a blog to record weekly meeting minutes, I could choose to enable that section.

So there would be a global UXSoc website (uxsociety.org) that is like the spec, but featuring content on a global scale. Then there would be subdomains for each chapter (chapman.uxsociety.org, admu.uxsociety.org, dlsu, addu) which feature content that is specific to that particular chapter.

With that, me and my co-founder Michael have begun coding components from the spec using Hugo: https://github.com/xaviablaza/hugo-uxsoc-theme

As a proof of concept, we were able to translate @Alexis' portfolio to be a modular site - we can add front-end sections and enable/disable sections at our will depending on what we need. https://xaviablaza.github.io/hugo-lodi-theme-demo/

Building a system like this would enforce good knowledge longevity and transfer of knowledge from senior uxsoc members to new founders. UXSoc will be larger than ateneo and the philippines, so it is good to prepare for this.
