- I honestly don't like that they feed his ego. It's large enough as is

Xavi
- HAHAHAHAHA
- its good posture
- makes for a great leader
- people are attached to accolades and qualification
- and if they like alexis because of that
- then yeah it's good for him

- I mean the podcast idea is a good thing and I applaud it but oh my god
- The idol part worries me

Xavi
- only time people wont call him idol is when someone whos younger and better than him arises
- i should ghostwrite for him
- how 2 be cult leader 101

- Maybe but I just don't want his ego to grow. It was good before I graduated. Now, I'm not entirely sure?

Xavi
- at the same time though
- what are we gonna do
- HAHAHA
- can talk about the greats all day long
- i think some people in uxsoc are like that
- back home
- we talk about the greats who have achieved a lot but i'd say most people are just like bahala sa buhay ko
- which makes me have this wtf kinda thinking
- which probably also contributes to entitledness

redacted
- :))) do you understand why it's sort of easier to succeed there than here
- It's exactly that lol
- I've met only a few people who have the sort of drive that Alexis has
- But then again there are people who are just naturally smart (like the people who get in p and g)
